But if you’re short for time (or short of breath), you can drive up to the top of Reabold Hill and take in the ocean and city views from the summit lookout.

From a height of 200 metres, it drops down towards the Swan Coastal Plain, carving its way through the granite slope and eventually drains into the Canning River. The best (and only) way to experience Whistlepipe Gully is by following the 3.6km walking trail that takes you up one side of the creek and then loops back down the other side – from late winter to early summer, you’ll find the area filled with a huge variety of wildflowers and orchids.",

Both are just a short drive from the city, and during winter become pretty impressive destinations for day hikes and picnics. Lesmurdie Falls is the largest waterfall in the Hills, with a 40 metre plummet into the valley and a series of platforms for you to get close to the action.\nAlthough Bells Rapids is a beautiful spot in itself, just a few hundred metres away is its lesser-known sibling, Bells Falls. If you park at Bells Lookout, look at the rapids and walk at a 45 degree angle, you’ll come across a hidden waterfall with beautiful views over the city and an informal firepit which can be used outside of the fire ban season. After heavy rainfall, this forgotten 25m waterfall can be heard before it’s seen. It is truly a beautiful sight, but getting there without a strictly defined path (at least not until the very end) can be quite daunting, so only go if you are feeling up to it.",

Every Wednesday (or Wednipsday), Cold Nips gathers like-minded, cold-loving maniacs to go for a hump-day dip. Their mantra is meet, splash, vibe – and it’s a truly invigorating way to start the day.",

      "We may be just simple folk, but we certainly enjoy the finer things in life every now and then – and if you’re going for bougie, State Buildings has got you covered. The Buildings are home to a stunning assortment of luxurious wining, dining, retail and more – whether it’s browsing the wares of Edicole or Lessons, lunch at Post or Petition, an evening drink at Beer Corner or Poole’s Temple or a six course tasting menu at Wildflower. Obviously, the only way to round out this day is with a stay at COMO The Treasury (and a visit to the Shambhala Urban Escape, of course).",

      "If you’re ancient like us, you’ll remember a time before all these charming small bars. It was pubs, clubs and more pubs – and then, the introduction of the small bar license in 2006 changed everything. Paired with the Melbourne-shaped chip on our shoulders, and suddenly there was a whole bunch of chatter about some teeny-tiny, hidden laneway bars. Helvetica was one of the first on the scene, with its legendary whisk(e)y selection, with cool-kids hangout Ezra Pound opening in the same year. Since then, we’ve made small bars our oeuvre, with stalwarts and newbies surviving through booms, busts and pandemics. Whether you’re looking for your new favourite neighbourhood spot, or a cosy courtyard for your next glass of pinot, we’ve got enough quirky small bars to finally put to rest any inferiority complexes we may have once had.",
